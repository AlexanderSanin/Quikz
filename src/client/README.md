## Getting Started

This is a simple guide to help you get started with your React project built using Vite.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open your React app in the browser. By default, it should be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be available in the `dist/` directory. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server or hosting platform.

### Preview the Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This command allows you to test the production build in a local environment.
